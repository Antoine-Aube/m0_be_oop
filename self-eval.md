# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

That was awesome! Going to the study hall with Cydnee was defintely very helpful to answer some questions. Tyler had some nice logical solutions that with some code that I had dabbled with in the past and seeing his solution helped to job my memory. This felt great! I'd never messed with classes before and this felt like a breeze so definitely a big confidence boost!

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Today was a bit more challenging in some respect. The pairing went great with Noelle, the exercises were also great, but I took my time and experimented with some where I could have just moved on and been a bit more efficient. The group OOP session was a bit more challenging, I felt was though I understood the material quickly but my teammates did not. They complained that the instructions weren't clear but I felt they were just the right amount of clarity! After 1.5 hrs of us working together, I suggested we try to go our own ways, mostly because I wasn't able to help them understand the content anymore. I was also excited to dive into classes on my own. Now I can be of more help though because I understand the material much more!

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

Attribute reader is crucial to recalling attributes on objects. Don't be afraid to mes around, google a lot, and ask experience people for guidance!
